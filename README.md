Exploring COVID-19 Data: An Analysis with SQL Queries
Introduction
This project is a comprehensive exploration of COVID-19 data using SQL. It analyzes critical aspects such as deaths, vaccinations, and demographic impacts through a variety of queries. By examining this dataset, the project aims to uncover insights about the pandemic's global and local impact, leveraging SQL’s powerful capabilities for data analysis.

Queries Overview
Deaths by Continent

Retrieves all data from the CovidDeaths$ table for non-null continents.
Orders the results by specified columns to identify patterns.
Deaths with Specific Columns and Ordering

Focuses on selected columns (location, date, etc.) for a structured view of deaths.
Filters and orders by location and date.
Death Percentage in Specific Locations

Calculates death percentages for locations with "states" in their name, providing localized insights.
Orders results by location and date.
Death Percentage with Population Factor

Expands on death percentage calculations by including new cases and population data for demographic analysis.
Countries with Highest Infection Rates

Identifies countries with the highest infection rates relative to population.
Groups and orders data by infection percentage in descending order.
Total Deaths by Continent

Summarizes total deaths for each continent.
Orders results to highlight regions with the highest impact.
Total Deaths Where Continent is Null

Examines deaths in locations without a defined continent.
Offers insights into unclassified regions.
Global COVID-19 Statistics

Computes global statistics, including total cases, deaths, and death percentages, providing a macroscopic view.
Rolling Vaccination Data with Join

Combines CovidDeaths$ and CovidVaccinations$ data to calculate rolling vaccination counts by location and date.
CTE for Vaccination Percentages

Uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate vaccination percentages dynamically based on population.
Temporary Table for Vaccination Percentages

Stores intermediate vaccination data in a temporary table before computing percentages.
View for Later Vaccination Analysis

Creates a reusable view (PercentVaccinated) for storing rolling vaccination data for future queries.
Key Features
Dynamic Analysis: Queries leverage CTEs, temporary tables, and views for dynamic, reusable analyses.
Insightful Metrics: Calculates death percentages, infection rates, and vaccination progress at global and local levels.
Data Integration: Combines multiple datasets (CovidDeaths$, CovidVaccinations$) for enriched insights.
Ordered Visualizations: Ensures ordered results for better interpretation and pattern recognition.
Conclusion
This portfolio showcases the power of SQL in uncovering actionable insights from COVID-19 data. By combining targeted queries with advanced SQL techniques, the project highlights the pandemic's impact on different regions and populations. It serves as a foundational toolkit for data analysts seeking to explore similar datasets and extract meaningful patterns for decision-making.
